    "## Generating Shakespearean Text Using a Character RNN\n",
    "In a famous 2015 blog post titled [“The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks”](https://homl.info/charrnn), Andrej Karpathy showed how to train an RNN to predict the next character in a sentence. This *char-RNN* can then be used to generate novel text, one character at a time. This is our first example of a *language model*; similar language models, are at the core of modern NLP.\n",

This is called *greedy decoding*. But in practice this often leads to the same words being repeated over and over again. Instead, we can sample the next character randomly, with a probability equal to the estimated probability, using TensorFlow’s `tf.random.categorical()` function. This will generate more diverse and interesting text. The `categorical()` function samples random class indices, given the class log probabilities (logits)."

    "### Stateful RNN\n",
    "We have only used *stateless RNNs*: at each training iteration the model starts with a hidden state full of zeros, then it updates this state at each time step, and after the last time step, it throws it away as it is not needed anymore. If we instruct the RNN to preserve this final state after processing a training batch and use it as the initial state for the next training batch, the model could learn long-term patterns despite only backpropagating through short sequences. This is called a *stateful RNN*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stateful RNN only makes sense if each input sequence in a batch starts exactly where the corresponding sequence in the previous batch left off. So we need to use sequential and nonoverlapping input sequences. When creating the `tf.data.Dataset`, we must therefore use `shift=length` when calling the `window()` method. Moreover, we must not call the `shuffle()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batching is much harder. If we were to call `batch(32)`, then 32 consecutive windows would be put in the same batch, and the following batch would not continue each of these windows where it left off. The first batch would contain windows 1 to 32 and the second batch would contain windows 33 to 64, so if we consider, say, the first window of each batch (i.e., windows 1 and 33), we can see that they are not consecutive. The simplest solution to this problem is to just use a batch size of 1."

    "This time we will chop it into words instead of characters. Note that it will not work well in some languages. e.g. Chinese writing does not use spaces between words, Vietnamese uses spaces even within words, and German often attaches multiple words together, without spaces. Even in English, spaces are not always the best way to tokenize text: think of “San Francisco” or “#ILoveDeepLearning”.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2016 paper [“Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units”](https://homl.info/rarewords) Rico Sennrich et al. from the University of Edinburgh explored several methods to tokenize and detokenize text at the subword level. This way, even if our model encounters a rare word it has never seen before, it can still reasonably guess what it means. e.g. if the model never saw the word “smartest” during training, if it learned the word “smart” and it also learned that the suffix “est” means “the most”, it can infer the meaning of “smartest”. One of the techniques the authors evaluated is *byte pair encoding* (BPE). BPE works by splitting the whole training set into individual characters (including spaces), then repeatedly merging the most frequent adjacent pairs until the vocabulary reaches the desired size.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2018 paper [“Subword Regularization: Improving Neural Network Translation Models with Multiple Subword Candidates”](https://homl.info/subword) by Taku Kudo at Google further improved subword tokenization, often removing the need for language-specific preprocessing prior to tokenization. Moreover, the paper proposed a novel regularization technique called *subword regularization*, which improves accuracy and robustness by introducing some randomness in tokenization during training: e.g. “New England” may be tokenized as “New” + “England”, or “New” + “Eng” + “land”, or simply “New England” (just one token). Google’s [*SentencePiece*](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) project provides an open source implementation, which is described in a 2018 paper [“SentencePiece: A Simple and Language Independent Subword Tokenizer and Detokenizer for Neural Text Processing”](https://homl.info/sentencepiece) by Taku Kudo and John Richardson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [TensorFlow Text](https://homl.info/tftext) library also implements various tokenization strategies, including WordPiece (a variant of BPE by Yonghui Wu et al., [“Google’s Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap Between Human and Machine Translation”](https://homl.info/wordpiece) in 2016), and last but not least, the [Tokenizers library by Hugging Face](https://homl.info/tokenizers) implements a wide range of extremely fast tokenizers.\n",

    "The way this works is that the `Embedding` layer creates a mask tensor equal to `tf.math.not_equal(inputs, 0)`: it is a Boolean tensor with the same shape as the inputs, and it is equal to `False` anywhere the token IDs are 0, or `True` otherwise. This mask tensor is then automatically propagated by the model to the next layer. If that layer’s `call()` method has a `mask` argument, then it automatically receives the mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the layer to ignore the appropriate time steps. Each layer may handle the mask differently, but in general they simply ignore masked time steps. e.g. when a recurrent layer encounters a masked time step, it simply copies the output from the previous time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, if the layer’s `supports_masking` attribute is `True`, then the mask is automatically propagated to the next layer. It keeps propagating this way for as long as the layers have `supports_masking=True`. e.g. a recurrent layer’s `supports_masking` attribute is `True` when `return_sequences=True`, but it’s `False` when `return_sequences=False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip**: Some layers need to update the mask before propagating it to the next layer: they do so by implementing the `compute_mask()` method, which takes two arguments: the inputs and the previous mask. It then computes the updated mask and returns it. The default implementation of `compute_mask()` just returns the previous mask unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the mask propagates all the way to the output, then it gets applied to the losses as well, so the masked time steps will not contribute to the loss (their loss will be 0)\n",

    "**Warning**: The LSTM and GRU layers have an optimized implementation for GPUs, based on Nvidia’s cuDNN library. However, this implementation only supports masking if all the padding tokens are at the end of the sequences. It also requires us to use the default values for several hyperparameters: `activation`, `recurrent_activation`, `recurrent_dropout`, `unroll`, `use_bias`, and `reset_after`. If that’s not the case, then these layers will fall back to the (much slower) default GPU implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our model does not start with an `Embedding` layer, we may use the `keras.layers.Masking` layer instead: by default, it sets the mask to `tf.math.reduce_any(tf.math.not_equal(X, 0), axis=-1)`, meaning that time steps where the last dimension is full of zeros will be masked out in subsequent layers.\n",

In other words, during training the decoder is given as input the word that it *should* have output at the previous step, regardless of what it actually output. This is called *teacher forcing*, a technique that significantly speeds up training and improves the model’s performance.

    "### Optimizing the Output Layer\n",
    "If the target vocabulary contained, say, 50,000 Spanish words instead of 1,000, then the decoder would output 50,000-dimensional vectors, and computing the softmax function over such a large vector would be very computationally intensive. To avoid this, one solution is to look only at the logits output by the model for the correct word and for a random sample of incorrect words, then compute an approximation of the loss based only on these logits. This *sampled softmax* technique was introduced in a 2015 paper [“On Using Very Large Target Vocabulary for Neural Machine Translation”](https://homl.info/104) by Sébastien Jean et al. In TensorFlow we can use the `tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss()` function for this during training and use the normal softmax function at inference time (sampled softmax cannot be used at inference time because it requires knowing the target).\n",
    "\n",
    "An extra thing we can do to speed up training is to tie the weights of the output layer to the transpose of the decoder’s embedding matrix (See Chapter 17). This significantly reduces the number of model parameters, which speeds up training and may sometimes improve the model’s accuracy as well, especially if we don’t have a lot of training data. The embedding matrix is equivalent to one-hot encoding followed by a linear layer with no bias term and no activation function that maps the one-hot vectors to the embedding space. The output layer does the reverse. So, if the model can find an embedding matrix whose transpose is close to its inverse (such a matrix is called an *orthogonal matrix*), then there’s no need to learn a separate set of weights for the output layer.\n",

    "A regular recurrent layer is *causal*, meaning it cannot look into the future. This type of RNN makes sense when forecasting time series, or in the decoder of a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model. But for tasks like text classification, or in the encoder of a seq2seq model, it is often preferable to look ahead at the next words before encoding a given word. Consider the phrases “the right arm”, “the right person”, and “the right to criticize”. One solution is to run two recurrent layers on the same inputs, one reading the words from left to right and the other reading them from right to left, then combine their outputs at each time step, typically by concatenating them. This is what a *bidirectional recurrent layer* does.\n",

The function first uses the model to find the top *k* words to start the translations (where *k* is the beam width). For each of the top *k* translations, it evaluates the conditional probabilities of top *k* words it could add to that translation. These extended translations and their probabilities are added to the list of candidates. Once we’ve gone through all top *k* translations and all top *k* words that could complete them, we keep only the top *k* candidates with the highest probability, and we iterate over and over until they all finish with an EOS token. The top translation is then returned (after removing its EOS token).\n",

As we add more words, the probability gets smaller and smaller. To avoid the risk of it getting too small, which could cause floating point precision errors, the function keeps track of log probabilities instead of probabilities: recall that $\\log(ab)=log(a)+log(b)$, therefore $\\log(p(S^\\prime))=\\log(p(S))+\\log(p(W|S))$."

    "  We now also send all of the encoder’s outputs to the decoder. Since the decoder cannot deal with all these encoder outputs at once, they need to be aggregated: at each time step, the decoder’s memory cell computes a weighted sum of all the encoder outputs to determine which words to focus on. The weight $\\alpha_{(t,i)}$ is the weight of the $i^{\\text{th}}$ encoder output at the $t^{\\text{th}}$ decoder time step. Then it uses this weighted sum to compute the decoder’s current hidden state. The rest of the decoder works just like earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "  These $\\alpha_{(t,i)}$ weights are generated by a small neural network called an *alignment model* (or an *attention layer*), which is trained jointly with the rest of the encoder–decoder model. It starts with a `Dense` layer composed of a single neuron to process each of the encoder’s outputs, along with the decoder’s previous hidden. This layer outputs a score (or energy) for each encoder output (e.g., $e_{(3,2)}$): this score measures how well each output is aligned with the decoder’s previous hidden state. e.g. in the figure above, the model has already output “me gusta el” (meaning “I like”), so it’s now expecting a noun: the word “soccer” is the one that best aligns with the current state, so it gets a high score. Finally, all the scores go through a softmax layer to get a final weight for each encoder output (e.g., $\\alpha_{(3,2)}$). Since it concatenates the encoder output with the decoder’s previous hidden state, it is sometimes called *concatenative attention* (or *additive attention*).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Note**: If the input sentence is $n$ words long, and assuming the output sentence is about as long, then this model will need to compute about $n^2$ weights. Fortunately, this quadratic computational complexity is still tractable because even long sentences don’t have thousands of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Luong attention*\n",
    "- Or *multiplicative attention*, was proposed shortly after, in a 2015 paper [“Effective Approaches to Attention-Based Neural Machine Translation”](https://homl.info/luongattention), by Minh-Thang Luong et al. Because the goal of the alignment model is to measure the similarity between one of the encoder’s outputs and the decoder’s previous hidden state, the authors proposed to simply compute the dot product of these two vectors, as this is often a fairly good similarity measure, and modern hardware can compute it very efficiently. For this, both vectors must have the same dimensionality. The dot product gives a score, and all the scores (at a given decoder time step) go through a softmax layer to give the final weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "  They also proposed to use the decoder’s hidden state at the current time step rather than at the previous time step (i.e., $\\mathbf{h}_{(t)}$ rather than $\\mathbf{h}_{(t-1)}$), then to use the output of the attention mechanism (noted $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{h}}_{(t)}$) directly to compute the decoder’s predictions, rather than using it to compute the decoder’s current hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "  They also proposed a variant of the dot product mechanism where the encoder outputs first go through a fully connected layer (without a bias term) before the dot products are computed. This is called the “general” dot product approach. The researchers compared both dot product approaches with the concatenative attention mechanism (adding a rescaling parameter vector $v$), and they observed that the dot product variants performed better than concatenative attention.\n",

    "\n",
    "e.g. let’s suppose the encoder analyzed the input sentence “I like soccer”, and it managed to understand that the word “I” is the subject and the word “like” is the verb, so it encoded this information in its outputs for these words. Now suppose the decoder has already translated the subject, and it thinks that it should translate the verb next. For this, it needs to fetch the verb from the input sentence. This is analogous to a dictionary lookup: it’s as if the encoder had created a dictionary {\"subject”: “They”, “verb”: “played”, ...} and the decoder wanted to look up the value that corresponds to the key “verb”.However, the model does not have discrete tokens to represent the keys (like “subject” or “verb”); instead, it has vectorized representations of these concepts that it learned during training, so the query it will use for the lookup will not perfectly match any key in the dictionary. The solution is to compute a similarity measure between the query and each key in the dictionary, and then use the softmax function to convert these similarity scores to weights that add up to 1. As we saw earlier, that’s exactly what the attention layer does. If the key that represents the verb is by far the most similar to the query, then that key’s weight will be close to 1. Next, the attention layer computes a weighted sum of the corresponding values: if the weight of the “verb” key is close to 1, then the weighted sum will be very close to the representation of the word “played”.\n",

    "Let’s go to details:\n",
    "- Both the encoder and the decoder contain modules that are stacked $N$ times. In the paper, $N=6$. The final outputs of the whole encoder stack are fed to the decoder at each of these $N$ levels.\n",
    "- There are two embedding layers; \n",

    "  - The decoder’s *masked multi-head attention* layer does the same thing, but when it processes a word, it doesn’t attend to words located after it: it’s a causal layer.\n",
    "  - The decoder’s upper *multi-head attention* layer is where the decoder pays attention to the words in the English sentence. This is called *cross*-attention, not *self*-attention in this case.\n",
    "  - The *positional encodings* are dense vectors (much like word embeddings) that represent the position of each word in the sentence. The $n^{\\text{th}}$ positional encoding is added to the word embedding of the $n^{\\text{th}}$ word in each sentence.

To prevent this matrix from being huge, the input sequences must not be too long. The final output has a shape of [$n_{queries}$, $d_{values}$]: there is one row per query, where each row represents the query result (a weighted sum of the values).\n",
    "- The scaling factor $1/(\\sqrt{d_{keys}})$ scales down the similarity scores to avoid saturating the softmax function, which would lead to tiny gradients.\n",
    "- It is possible to mask out some key/value pairs by adding a very large negative value to the corresponding similarity scores, just before computing the softmax. This is useful in the masked multi-head attention layer.\n",

    "**Note**: the Attention layer’s inputs are just like $\\mathbf{Q}$, $\\mathbf{K}$, and $\\mathbf{V}$, except with an extra batch dimension (the first dimension). Internally, the layer computes all the attention scores for all sentences in the batch with just one call to `tf.matmul(queries, keys)`:In TensorFlow, if `A` and `B` are tensors with more than two dimensions, say, of shape [2, 3, 4, 5] and [2, 3, 5, 6], respectively, then `tf.matmul(A, B)` will treat these tensors as 2 $\\times$ 3 arrays where each cell contains a matrix, and it will multiply the corresponding matrices: the matrix at the $i^{\\text{th}}$ row and $j^{\\text{th}}$ column in `A` will be multiplied by the matrix at the $i^{\\text{th}}$ row and $j^{\\text{th}}$ column in B. Since the product of a 4 $\\times$ 5 matrix with a 5 $\\times$ 6 matrix is a 4 $\\times$ 6 matrix, `tf.matmul(A, B)` will return an array of shape [2, 3, 4, 6].\n",

    "## An Avalanche of Transformer Models\n",
    "The year 2018 has been called the “ImageNet moment for NLP”. Since then, progress has been astounding, with larger and larger transformer-based architectures trained on immense datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, the GPT paper [“Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training”](https://homl.info/gpt) by Alec Radford and other OpenAI researchers in 2018 once again demonstrated the effectiveness of unsupervised pretraining, like the ELMo and ULMFiT papers before it, but this time using a transformer-like architecture. The authors pretrained a large but fairly simple architecture composed of a stack of 12 transformer modules using only masked multi-head attention layers, like in the original transformer’s decoder. They trained it on a very large dataset, using the same autoregressive technique we used for our Shakespearean char-RNN: just predict the next token. This is a form of self-supervised learning. Then they fine-tuned it on various language tasks, using only minor adaptations for each task: text classification, *entailment* (whether sentence A imposes, involves, or implies sentence B as a necessary consequence), similarity (e.g., “Nice weather today” is very similar to “It is sunny”), and question answering (given a few paragraphs of text giving some context, the model must answer some multiple-choice questions).\n",
    "- Then in 2019 Google’s BERT paper [“BERT: Pre-Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding”](https://homl.info/bert) by Jacob Devlin et al. came out: it also demonstrated the effectiveness of self-supervised pretraining on a large corpus, using a similar architecture to GPT but with nonmasked multi-head attention layers only, like in the original transformer’s encoder. This means that the model is naturally bidirectional; hence the B in BERT (*Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers*). The authors proposed two pretraining tasks that explain most of the model’s strength:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  *Masked language model (MLM)*\n",
    "  - Each word in a sentence has a 15% probability of being masked, and the model is trained to predict the masked words. And then each selected word has an 80% chance of being masked, a 10% chance of being replaced by a random word (to reduce the discrepancy between pretraining and fine-tuning, since the model will not see \\<mask> tokens during fine-tuning), and a 10% chance of being left alone (to bias the model toward the correct answer).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  *Next sentence prediction (NSP)*\n",
    "  - The model is trained to predict whether two sentences are consecutive or not. \n",
    "  Later research showed that NSP was not as important as was initially thought, \n",
    "  so it was dropped in most later architectures.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The model is trained on these two tasks simultaneously.\n",
    "  \n",

    "      \"\n",
    "    >\n",
    "  </center>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For the NSP task, the authors inserted a class token (\\<CLS>) at the start of every input. The two input sentences are concatenated, separated only by a special separation token (\\<SEP>), and they are fed as input to the model. To help the model know which sentence each input token belongs to, a *segment embedding* is added on top of each token’s positional embeddings. The loss is only computed on the NSP prediction and the masked tokens, not on the unmasked ones.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  After this the model is then fine-tuned on many different tasks, changing very little for each task. e.g. for text classification such as sentiment analysis, all output tokens are ignored except for the first one, corresponding to the class token, and a new output layer replaces the previous one, which was just a binary classification layer for NSP.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In February 2019, Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, and other OpenAI researchers published the GPT-2 paper [“Language Models Are Unsupervised Multitask Learners”](https://homl.info/gpt2), which proposed a very similar architecture to GPT, but larger still (with over 1.5 billion parameters!). The researchers showed that the new and improved GPT model could perform *zero-shot learning* (ZSL), meaning it could achieve good performance on many tasks without any fine-tuning.\n",
    "- Google’s [“Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity”](https://homl.info/switch) introduced in January 2021 used 1 trillion parameters, and soon much larger models came out, such as the Wu Dao 2.0 model by the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAII), announced in June 2021.\n",
    "- Luckily, ingenious researchers are finding new ways to downsize transformers and make them more data-efficient. e.g. the [“DistilBERT, A Distilled Version of Bert: Smaller, Faster, Cheaper and Lighter”](https://homl.info/distilbert) model, introduced in October 2019 by Victor Sanh et al. from Hugging Face, is a small and fast transformer model based on BERT. It is available on Hugging Face’s excellent model hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "  DistilBERT was trained using *distillation* (hence the name): this means transferring knowledge from a teacher model to a student one, which is usually much smaller than the teacher model. This is typically done by using the teacher’s predicted probabilities for each training instance as targets for the student. Surprisingly, distillation often works better than training the student from scratch on the same dataset as the teacher! Indeed, the student benefits from the teacher’s more nuanced labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many more transformer architectures came out after BERT, almost on a monthly basis, often improving on the state of the art across all NLP tasks: XLNet (June 2019), RoBERTa (July 2019), StructBERT (August 2019), ALBERT (September 2019), T5 (October 2019), ELECTRA (March 2020), GPT3 (May 2020), DeBERTa (June 2020), Switch Transformers (January 2021), Wu Dao 2.0 (June 2021), Gopher (December 2021), GPT-NeoX-20B (February 2022), Chinchilla (March 2022), OPT (May 2022), and the list goes on and on. Mariya Yao summarized many of these models in this post: https://homl.info/yaopost.\n",
    "- Let’s take a quick look at the T5 paper [“Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer”](https://homl.info/t5) by Colin Raffel et al. at Google: it frames all NLP tasks as text-to-text, using an encoder–decoder transformer. e.g. to translate “I like soccer” to Spanish, we can just call the model with the input sentence “translate English to Spanish: I like soccer” and it outputs “me gusta el fútbol”. To summarize a paragraph, we just enter “summarize:” followed by the paragraph, and it outputs the summary. For classification, we only need to change the prefix to “classify:” and the model outputs the class name, as text. This simplifies using the model, and it also makes it possible to pretrain it on even more tasks.\n",
    "- In April 2022, Google researchers used a new large-scale training platform named *Pathways* to train a humongous language model named the *Pathways Language Model* (PaLM) described in [“PaLM: Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways”](https://homl.info/palm) by Aakanksha Chowdhery et al. with a whopping 540 billion parameters, using over 6,000 TPUs. This model is a standard transformer, using only masked multi-head attention layers, with just a few tweaks. This model achieved incredible performance on all sorts of NLP tasks, particularly in natural language understanding (NLU). It’s capable of impressive feats, such as explaining jokes, giving detailed step-by-step answers to questions, and even coding. \n",
    "- PaLM strength is in part due to the model’s size, but also thanks to a technique called *Chain of thought prompting*, which was introduced a couple months earlier by another team of Google researchers in [“Chain of Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models”](https://homl.info/ctp) by Jason Wei et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In question answering tasks, regular prompting typically includes a few examples of questions and answers, such as: “Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now? A: 11.” The prompt then continues with the actual question, such as “Q: John takes care of 10 dogs. Each dog takes .5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. How many hours a week does he spend taking care of dogs? A:”, and the model’s job is to append the answer: in this case, “35.”\n",
    "\n",
    "  But with chain of thought prompting, the example answers include all the reasoning steps that lead to the conclusion. e.g. instead of “A: 11”, the prompt contains “A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11.” This encourages the model to give a detailed answer to the actual question, such as “John takes care of 10 dogs. Each dog takes .5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. So that is 10 $\\times$ .5 = 5 hours a day. 5 hours a day $\\times$ 7 days a week = 35 hours a week. The answer is 35 hours a week.” This is an actual example from the paper!\n",
    "\n",
    "  Not only does the model give the right answer much more frequently than using regular prompting, we’re encouraging the model to think things through, but it also provides all the reasoning steps, which can be useful to better understand the rationale behind a model’s answer."

    "### Explainability\n",
    "One extra benefit of attention mechanisms is that they make it easier to understand what led the model to produce its output. This is called *explainability*. It can be especially useful when the model makes a mistake: e.g. if an image of a dog walking in the snow is labeled as “a wolf walking in the snow”, then we can go back and check what the model focused on when it output the word “wolf”. We may find that it was paying attention not only to the dog, but also to the snow, hinting at a possible explanation: perhaps the way the model learned to distinguish dogs from wolves is by checking whether or not there’s a lot of snow around. We can then fix this by training the model with more images of wolves without snow, and dogs with snow. This example comes from a great 2016 paper [“‘Why Should I Trust You?’: Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier”](https://homl.info/explainclass) by Marco Tulio Ribeiro et al. that uses a different approach to explainability: learning an interpretable model locally around a classifier’s prediction.\n",

    "- At first transformer used alongside CNNs, without replacing them. Instead, transformers were generally used to replace RNNs. Transformers became slightly more visual in a 2020 paper [“End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers”](https://homl.info/detr) by Nicolas Carion et al. in Facebook, which proposed a hybrid CNN–transformer architecture for object detection. The CNN first processes the input images and outputs a set of feature maps, then these feature maps are converted to sequences and fed to a transformer, which outputs bounding box predictions.\n",
    "- In October 2020, a team of Google researchers released a paper [“An Image Is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale”](https://homl.info/vit) Alexey Dosovitskiy et al. that introduced a fully transformer-based vision model, called a *vision transformer* (ViT). They choped the image into little 16 $\\times$ 16 squares, and treat the sequence of squares as if it were a sequence of word representations. The squares are first flattened into 16 $\\times$ 16 $\\times$ 3 = 768-dimensional vectors, then these vectors go through a linear layer that transforms them but retains their dimensionality. The resulting sequence of vectors can then be treated just like a sequence of word embeddings: this means adding positional embeddings, and passing the result to the transformer. This model beat the state of the art on ImageNet image classification, but the authors had to use over 300 million additional images for training. This makes sense since transformers don’t have as many *inductive biases* as convolution neural nets, so they need extra data just to learn things that CNNs implicitly assume.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: An inductive bias is an implicit assumption made by the model, due to its architecture. Linear models implicitly assume that the data is linear. CNNs implicitly assume that patterns learned in one location will likely be useful in other locations. RNNs implicitly assume that the inputs are ordered, and that recent tokens are more important than older ones. The more inductive biases a model has, assuming they are correct, the less training data the model will require.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Just two months later, a team of Facebook researchers led by Hugo Touvron released a paper [“Training Data-Efficient Image Transformers & Distillation Through Attention”](https://homl.info/deit) that introduced *data-efficient image transformers* (DeiTs). Their model achieved competitive results on ImageNet without requiring any additional data for training. The model’s architecture is virtually the same as the original ViT, but the authors used a distillation technique to transfer knowledge from state-of-the-art CNN models to their model.\n",
    "- In March 2021, DeepMind released an important paper [“Perceiver: General Perception with Iterative Attention”](https://homl.info/perceiver) by Andrew Jaegle et al., that introduced the *Perceiver* architecture.\n",
    "  - It is a *multimodal* transformer, meaning we can feed it text, images, audio, or virtually any other modality. Until then, transformers had been restricted to fairly short sequences because of the performance and RAM bottleneck in the attention layers. This excluded modalities such as audio or video, and it forced researchers to treat images as sequences of patches, rather than sequences of pixels. \n",
    "  - The bottleneck is due to self-attention, where every token must attend to every other token: if the input sequence has $M$ tokens, then the attention layer must compute an $M\\times M$ matrix, which can be huge if $M$ is very large.\n",
    "  - The Perceiver solves this problem by gradually improving a fairly short *latent representation* of the inputs, composed of $N$ tokens, typically just a few hundred. (The word *latent* means hidden, or internal.)\n",
    "  - The model uses cross-attention layers only, feeding them the latent representation as the queries, and the (possibly large) inputs as the values. This only requires computing an $M\\times N$ matrix, so the computational complexity is linear with regard to $M$, instead of quadratic. \n",
    "  - After going through several cross-attention layers, the latent representation ends up capturing everything that matters in the inputs. \n",
    "  - The authors also suggested sharing the weights between consecutive cross-attention layers: if we do that, then the Perceiver effectively becomes an RNN.\n",
    "    - The shared cross-attention layers can be seen as the same memory cell at different time steps\n",
    "    - And the latent representation corresponds to the cell’s context vector.\n",
    "    - The same inputs are repeatedly fed to the memory cell at every time step.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    It looks like RNNs are not dead after all!\n",
    "- Just a month later, Mathilde Caron et al. introduced DINO in [“Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers”](https://homl.info/dino), an impressive vision transformer trained entirely without labels, using self-supervision, and capable of high-accuracy semantic segmentation. \n",
    "  - The model is duplicated during training, with one network acting as a teacher and the other acting as a student. \n",
    "  - Gradient descent only affects the student, while the teacher’s weights are just an exponential moving average of the student’s weights.\n",
    "  - The student is trained to match the teacher’s predictions: since they’re almost the same model, this is called *self-distillation*.\n",
    "  - At each training step, the input images are augmented in different ways for the teacher and the student, so they don’t see the exact same image, but their predictions must match. This forces them to come up with high-level representations.\n",
    "  - To prevent *mode collapse*, where both the student and the teacher would always output the same thing, completely ignoring the inputs, DINO keeps track of a moving average of the teacher’s outputs, and it tweaks the teacher’s predictions to ensure that they remain centered on zero, on average.\n",
    "  - DINO also forces the teacher to have high confidence in its predictions: this is called *sharpening*.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Together, these techniques preserve diversity in the teacher’s outputs.\n",
    "- In a 2021 paper [“Scaling Vision Transformers”](https://homl.info/scalingvits) by Xiaohua Zhai et al., Google researchers showed how to scale ViTs up or down, depending on the amount of data. They managed to create a huge 2 billion parameter model that reached over 90.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Conversely, they also trained a scaled-down model that reached over 84.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using only 10,000 images: that’s just 10 images per class!\n",
    "- In March 2022, a paper [“Model Soups: Averaging Weights of Multiple Fine-tuned Models Improves Accuracy Without Increasing Inference Time”](https://homl.info/modelsoups) by Mitchell Wortsman et al. demonstrated that it’s possible to first train multiple transformers, then average their weights to create a new and improved model. This is similar to an ensemble, except there’s just one model in the end, which means there’s no inference time penalty.\n",
    "- OpenAI’s 2021 CLIP paper [“Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision”](https://homl.info/clip) Alec Radford et al. proposed a large transformer model pretrained to match captions with images: this task allows it to learn excellent image representations, and the model can then be used directly for tasks such as image classification using simple text prompts such as “a photo of a cat”.\n",
    "- Soon after, OpenAI announced DALL·E paper [“Zero-Shot Text-to-Image Generation”](https://homl.info/dalle), capable of generating amazing images based on text prompts and then DALL·E 2 paper [“Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents”](https://homl.info/dalle2) which generates even higher quality images using a diffusion model both by Aditya Ramesh et al.\n",
    "- In April 2022, DeepMind released the Flamingo paper [“Flamingo: a Visual Language Model for Few-Shot Learning”](https://homl.info/flamingo) by Jean-Baptiste Alayrac et al., which introduced a family of models pretrained on a wide variety of tasks across multiple modalities, including text, images, and videos. A single model can be used across very different tasks, such as question answering, image captioning, and more.\n",

    "### 1. to 8.\n",
    "1. What are the pros and cons of using a stateful RNN versus a stateless RNN?\n",
    "> Stateless RNNs can only capture patterns whose length is less than, or equal to, the size of the windows the RNN is trained on. Conversely, stateful RNNs can capture longer-term patterns. However, implementing a stateful RNN is much harder⁠, especially preparing the dataset properly. Moreover, stateful RNNs do not always work better, in part because consecutive batches are not independent and identically distributed (IID). Gradient descent is not fond of non-IID datasets.\n",
    "2. Why do people use encoder–decoder RNNs rather than plain sequence-to-sequence RNNs for automatic translation?\n",
    "> In general, if we translate a sentence one word at a time, the result will be terrible. e.g. the French sentence “Je vous en prie” means “You are welcome”, but if we translate it one word at a time, we get “I you in pray” Huh? It is much better to read the whole sentence first and then translate it. A plain sequence-to-sequence RNN would start translating a sentence immediately after reading the first word, while an encoder–decoder RNN will first read the whole sentence and then translate it. That said, one could imagine a plain sequence-to-sequence RNN that would output silence whenever it is unsure about what to say next (just like human translators do when they must translate a live broadcast).\n",
    "3. How can we deal with variable-length input sequences? What about variable-length output sequences?\n",
    "> Variable-length input sequences can be handled by padding the shorter sequences so that all sequences in a batch have the same length, and using masking to ensure the RNN ignores the padding token. For better performance, we may also want to create batches containing sequences of similar sizes. Ragged tensors can hold sequences of variable lengths, and Keras now supports them, which simplifies handling variable-length input sequences (at the time of this writing, it still does not handle ragged tensors as targets on the GPU, though). Regarding variable-length output sequences, if the length of the output sequence is known in advance (e.g., if we know that it is the same as the input sequence), then we just need to configure the loss function so that it ignores tokens that come after the end of the sequence. Similarly, the code that will use the model should ignore tokens beyond the end of the sequence. But generally the length of the output sequence is not known ahead of time, so the solution is to train the model so that it outputs an end-of-sequence token at the end of each sequence.\n",
    "4. What is beam search, and why would we use it? What tool can we use to implement it?\n",
    "> Beam search is a technique used to improve the performance of a trained encoder–decoder model, e.g. in a neural machine translation system. The algorithm keeps track of a short list of the *k* most promising output sentences (say, the top three), and at each decoder step it tries to extend them by one word; then it keeps only the *k* most likely sentences. The parameter *k* is called the *beam width*: the larger it is, the more CPU and RAM will be used, but also the more accurate the system will be. Instead of greedily choosing the most likely next word at each step to extend a single sentence, this technique allows the system to explore several promising sentences simultaneously. Moreover, this technique lends itself well to parallelization. we can implement beam search by writing a custom memory cell. Alternatively, TensorFlow Addons’s seq2seq API provides an implementation.\n",
    "5. What is an attention mechanism? How does it help?\n",
    "> An attention mechanism is a technique initially used in encoder–decoder models to give the decoder more direct access to the input sequence, allowing it to deal with longer input sequences. At each decoder time step, the current decoder’s state and the full output of the encoder are processed by an alignment model that outputs an alignment score for each input time step. This score indicates which part of the input is most relevant to the current decoder time step. The weighted sum of the encoder output (weighted by their alignment score) is then fed to the decoder, which produces the next decoder state and the output for this time step. The main benefit of using an attention mechanism is the fact that the encoder–decoder model can successfully process longer input sequences. Another benefit is that the alignment scores make the model easier to debug and interpret: e.g. if the model makes a mistake, we can look at which part of the input it was paying attention to, and this can help diagnose the issue. An attention mechanism is also at the core of the transformer architecture, in the multi-head attention layers. See the next answer.\n",
    "6. What is the most important layer in the transformer architecture? What is its purpose?\n",
    "> The multi-head attention layer (the original transformer architecture contains 18 of them, including 6 masked multi-head attention layers). It is at the core of language models such as BERT and GPT-2. Its purpose is to allow the model to identify which words are most aligned with each other, and then improve each word’s representation using these contextual clues.\n",
    "7. When would we need to use sampled softmax?\n",
    "> Sampled softmax is used when training a classification model when there are many classes (e.g., thousands). It computes an approximation of the cross-entropy loss based on the logit predicted by the model for the correct class, and the predicted logits for a sample of incorrect words. This speeds up training considerably compared to computing the softmax over all logits and then estimating the cross-entropy loss. After training, the model can be used normally, using the regular softmax function to compute all the class probabilities based on all the logits.\n",
    "8. *Embedded Reber grammars* were used by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in [their paper](https://homl.info/93) about LSTMs. They are artificial grammars that produce strings such as “BPBTSXXVPSEPE”. Check out Jenny Orr’s [nice introduction](https://homl.info/108) to this topic, then choose a particular embedded Reber grammar (such as the one represented on Jenny Orr’s page), then train an RNN to identify whether a string respects that grammar or not. We will first need to write a function capable of generating a training batch containing about 50% strings that respect the grammar, and 50% that don’t.\n",
    "> First we need to build a function that generates strings based on a grammar. The grammar will be represented as a list of possible transitions for each state. A transition specifies the string to output (or a grammar to generate it) and the next state."
