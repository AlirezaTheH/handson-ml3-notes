This can be done when creating the GCP resource, by selecting the service account in the “Identity and API access” section. Some resources, such as VM instances, also let us attach the service account after the VM instance is created: we must stop it and edit its settings. In any case, once a service account is attached to a VM instance, or any other GCP resource running our code, GCP’s client libraries will automatically authenticate as the chosen service account, with no extra step needed.\n",

    "- If our application is not hosted on GCP, then we can either use the Workload Identity Federation service (that’s the safest but hardest option), or just generate an access key for our service account, save it to a JSON file, and point the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to it so our client application can access it. We can manage access keys by clicking the service account we just created, and then opening the KEYS tab. \n",

The simplest approach is called *post-training quantization*: it just quantizes the weights after training, using a fairly basic but efficient symmetrical quantization technique. It finds the maximum absolute weight value, $m$, then it maps the floating-point range $–m$ to $+m$ to the fixed-point (integer) range –127 to +127. e.g. if the weights range from –1.5 to +0.8, then the bytes –127, 0, and +127 will correspond to the floats –1.5, 0.0, and +1.5, respectively. Note that 0.0 always maps to 0 when using symmetrical quantization. Also note that the byte values +68 to +127 will not be used in this example, since they map to floats greater than +0.8.\n",

    "### Parallel Execution Across Multiple Devices\n",
    "One of the benefits of using TF functions is parallelism. When TensorFlow runs a TF function, it starts by analyzing its graph to find the list of operations that need to be evaluated, and it counts how many dependencies each of them has. TensorFlow then adds each operation with zero dependencies (i.e., each source operation) to the evaluation queue of this operation’s device. Once an operation has been evaluated, the dependency counter of each operation that depends on it is decremented. Once an operation’s dependency counter reaches zero, it is pushed to the evaluation queue of its device. And once all the outputs have been computed, they are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations in the CPU’s evaluation queue are dispatched to a thread pool called the *inter-op thread pool*. If the CPU has multiple cores, then these operations will effectively be evaluated in parallel. Some operations have multithreaded CPU kernels: these kernels split their tasks into multiple suboperations, which are placed in another evaluation queue and dispatched to a second thread pool called the *intra-op thread pool* (shared by all multithreaded CPU kernels). In short, multiple operations and suboperations may be evaluated in parallel on different CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations in a GPU’s evaluation queue are evaluated sequentially. However, most operations have multithreaded GPU kernels, typically implemented by libraries that TensorFlow depends on, such as CUDA and cuDNN. These implementations have their own thread pools, and they typically exploit as many GPU threads as they can (which is the reason why there is no need for an inter-op thread pool in GPUs: each operation already floods most GPU threads).\n",

Operations A and B are placed on the CPU, so they are sent to the CPU’s evaluation queue, then they are dispatched to the inter-op thread pool and immediately evaluated in parallel. Operation A happens to have a multi‐threaded kernel; its computations are split into three parts, which are executed in parallel by the intra-op thread pool. Operation C goes to GPU #0’s evaluation queue, and in this example its GPU kernel happens to use cuDNN, which manages its own intra-op thread pool and runs the operation across many GPU threads in parallel. Suppose C finishes first. The dependency counters of D and E are decremented and they reach 0, so both operations are pushed to GPU #0’s evaluation queue, and they are executed sequentially. Note that C only gets evaluated once, even though both D and E depend on it. Suppose B finishes next. Then F’s dependency counter is decremented from 4 to 3, and since that’s not 0, it does not run yet. Once A, D, and E are finished, then F’s dependency counter reaches 0, and it is pushed to the CPU’s evaluation queue and evaluated. Finally, TensorFlow returns the requested outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the TF function modifies a stateful resource, such as a variable, TensorFlow ensures that the order of execution matches the order in the code, even if there is no explicit dependency between the statements. e.g. if our TF function contains `v.assign_add(1)` followed by `v.assign(v * 2)`, TensorFlow will ensure that these operations are executed in that order.\n",

This is useful if we do not want TensorFlow to use all the CPU cores or if we want it to be single-threaded.

The downside is that the fast devices will have to wait for the slow ones at every step, making the whole process as slow as the slowest device.

They achieved this using a new technique called *pipeline parallelism*, which combines model parallelism and data parallelism: the model is chopped into consecutive parts, called *stages*, each of which is trained on a different machine. This results in an asynchronous pipeline in which all machines work in parallel with very little idle time. During training, each stage alternates one round of forward propagation and one round of backpropagation: it pulls a mini-batch from its input queue, processes it, and sends the outputs to the next stage’s input queue, then it pulls one mini-batch of gradients from its gradient queue, backpropagates these gradients and updates its own model parameters, and pushes the backpropagated gradients to the previous stage’s gradient queue.

We can also try dropping the float precision from 32 bits (`tf.float32`) to 16 bits (`tf.bfloat16`). If we are using centralized parameters, we can shard (split) the parameters across multiple parameter servers: adding more parameter servers will reduce the network load on each server and limit the risk of bandwidth saturation."

It has an IP address, a port, and a type (also called its *role* or its *job*, actually the set of tasks that share the same type is often called a *job*). The type can be either `'worker'`, `'chief'`, `'ps'` (parameter server), or `'evaluator'`:\n",

    "#### Hyperparameter Tuning Using Keras Tuner on Vertex AI\n",
    "Instead of using Vertex AI’s hyperparameter tuning service, we can use [Keras Tuner](https://keras.io/keras_tuner/) and run it on Vertex AI VMs. Keras Tuner provides a simple way to scale hyperparameter search by distributing it across multiple machines: it only requires setting three environment variables on each machine, then running our regular Keras Tuner code on each machine. We can use the exact same script on all machines. One of the machines acts as the chief (i.e., the oracle), and the others act as workers. Each worker asks the chief which hyperparameter values to try, then the worker trains the model using these hyperparameter values, and finally it reports the model’s performance back to the chief, which can then decide which hyperparameter values the worker should try next.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three environment variables we need to set on each machine are:\n",
    "- `KERASTUNER_TUNER_ID`: Equal to `'chief'` on the chief machine, or a unique identifier on each worker machine, such as `'worker0'`, `'worker1'`, etc.\n",
    "- `KERASTUNER_ORACLE_IP`: The IP address or hostname of the chief machine. The chief itself should generally use `'0.0.0.0'` to listen on every IP address on the machine.\n",
    "- `KERASTUNER_ORACLE_PORT`: The TCP port that the chief will be listening on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use distributed Keras Tuner on any set of machines. If we want to run it on Vertex AI machines, then we can spawn a regular training job, and just modify the training script to set the three environment variables properly before using Keras Tuner.\n",

    "#### Extra Material – Implement Distributed Keras Tuner on Vertex AI\n",
    "The script below starts by parsing the `TF_CONFIG` environment variable, which will be automatically set by Vertex AI, just like earlier. It finds the address of the task of type `'chief'`, and it extracts the IP address or hostname, and the TCP port. It then defines the tuner ID as the task type followed by the task index, for example `'worker0'`. If the tuner ID is `'chief0'`, it changes it to `'chief'`, and it sets the IP to `'0.0.0.0'`: this will make it listen on all IPv4 address on its machine. Then it defines the environment variables for Keras Tuner. Next, the script creates a tuner, then it runs the search, and finally it saves the best model to the location given by Vertex AI:"

    "## Exercises\n",
    "1. What does a SavedModel contain? How do we inspect its content?\n",
    "> A SavedModel contains a TensorFlow model, including its architecture (a computation graph) and its weights. It is stored as a directory containing a *saved_model.pb* file, which defines the computation graph (represented as a serialized protocol buffer), and a *variables* subdirectory containing the variable values. For models containing a large number of weights, these variable values may be split across multiple files. A SavedModel also includes an *assets* subdirectory that may contain additional data, such as vocabulary files, class names, or some example instances for this model. To be more accurate, a SavedModel can contain one or more *metagraphs*. A metagraph is a computation graph plus some function signature definitions (including their input and output names, types, and shapes). Each metagraph is identified by a set of tags. To inspect a SavedModel, we can use the command-line tool `saved_model_cli` or just load it using `tf.saved_model.load()` and inspect it in Python.\n",
    "2. When should we use TF Serving? What are its main features? What are some tools we can use to deploy it?\n",
    "> TF Serving allows us to deploy multiple TensorFlow models (or multiple versions of the same model) and make them accessible to all our applications easily via a REST API or a gRPC API. Using our models directly in our applications would make it harder to deploy a new version of a model across all applications. Implementing our own microservice to wrap a TF model would require extra work, and it would be hard to match TF Serving’s features. TF Serving has many features: it can monitor a directory and autodeploy the models that are placed there, and we won’t have to change or even restart any of our applications to benefit from the new model versions; it’s fast, well tested, and scales very well; and it supports A/B testing of experimental models and deploying a new model version to just a subset of our users (in this case the model is called a *canary*). TF Serving is also capable of grouping individual requests into batches to run them jointly on the GPU. To deploy TF Serving, we can install it from source, but it is much simpler to install it using a Docker image. To deploy a cluster of TF Serving Docker images, we can use an orchestration tool such as Kubernetes, or use a fully hosted solution such as Google Vertex AI.\n",
    "3. How do we deploy a model across multiple TF Serving instances?\n",
    "> All we need to do is configure these TF Serving instances to monitor the same *models* directory, and then export our new model as a SavedModel into a subdirectory.\n",
    "4. When should we use the gRPC API rather than the REST API to query a model served by TF Serving?\n",
    "> The gRPC API is more efficient than the REST API. However, its client libraries are not as widely available, and if we activate compression when using the REST API, we can get almost the same performance. So, the gRPC API is most useful when we need the highest possible performance and the clients are not limited to the REST API.\n",
    "5. What are the different ways TFLite reduces a model’s size to make it run on a mobile or embedded device?\n",
    "> - It provides a converter which can optimize a SavedModel: it shrinks the model and reduces its latency. To do this, it prunes all the operations that are not needed to make predictions (such as training operations), and it optimizes and fuses operations whenever possible.\n",
    "> - The converter can also perform post-training quantization: this technique dramatically reduces the model’s size, so it’s much faster to download and store.\n",
    "> - It saves the optimized model using the FlatBuffer format, which can be loaded to RAM directly, without parsing. This reduces the loading time and memory footprint.\n",
    "6. What is quantization-aware training, and why would we need it?\n",
    "> Quantization-aware training consists in adding fake quantization operations to the model during training. This allows the model to learn to ignore the quantization noise; the final weights will be more robust to quantization.\n",
    "7. What are model parallelism and data parallelism? Why is the latter generally recommended?\n",
    "> Model parallelism means chopping our model into multiple parts and running them in parallel across multiple devices, hopefully speeding up the model during training or inference. Data parallelism means creating multiple exact replicas of our model and deploying them across multiple devices. At each iteration during training, each replica is given a different batch of data, and it computes the gradients of the loss with regard to the model parameters. In synchronous data parallelism, the gradients from all replicas are then aggregated and the optimizer performs a gradient descent step. The parameters may be centralized (e.g., on parameter servers) or replicated across all replicas and kept in sync using AllReduce. In asynchronous data parallelism, the parameters are centralized and the replicas run independently from each other, each updating the central parameters directly at the end of each training iteration, without having to wait for the other replicas. To speed up training, data parallelism turns out to work better than model parallelism, in general. This is mostly because it requires less communication across devices. Moreover, it is much easier to implement, and it works the same way for any model, whereas model parallelism requires analyzing the model to determine the best way to chop it into pieces. That said, research in this domain is making quick progress (e.g., PipeDream or Pathways), so a mix of model parallelism and data parallelism is probably the way forward.\n",
    "8. When training a model across multiple servers, what distribution strategies can we use? How do we choose which one to use?\n",
    "> - The `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` performs mirrored data parallelism. The model is replicated across all available servers and devices, and each replica gets a different batch of data at each training iteration and computes its own gradients. The mean of the gradients is computed and shared across all replicas using a distributed AllReduce implementation (NCCL by default), and all replicas perform the same gradient descent step. This strategy is the simplest to use since all servers and devices are treated in exactly the same way, and it performs fairly well. In general, we should use this strategy. Its main limitation is that it requires the model to fit in RAM on every replica.\n",
    "> - The `ParameterServerStrategy` performs asynchronous data parallelism. The model is replicated across all devices on all workers, and the parameters are sharded across all parameter servers. Each worker has its own training loop, running asynchronously with the other workers; at each training iteration, each worker gets its own batch of data and fetches the latest version of the model parameters from the parameter servers, then it computes the gradients of the loss with regard to these parameters, and it sends them to the parameter servers. Lastly, the parameter servers perform a gradient descent step using these gradients. This strategy is generally slower than the previous strategy, and a bit harder to deploy, since it requires managing parameter servers. However, it can be useful in some situations, especially when we can take advantage of the asynchronous updates, e.g. to reduce I/O bottlenecks. This depends on many factors, including hardware, network topology, number of servers, model size, and more, so our mileage may vary.\n",
    "9. Train a model (any model we like) and deploy it to TF Serving or Google Vertex AI. Write the client code to query it using the REST API or the gRPC API. Update the model and deploy the new version. Our client code will now query the new version. Roll back to the first version\n",
    "> Please follow the steps in the [Using TensorFlow Serving](#using-tensorflow-serving) section above.\n",
    "10. Train any model across multiple GPUs on the same machine using the `MirroredStrategy` (if we do not have access to GPUs, we can use Google Colab with a GPU Runtime and create two virtual GPUs). Train the model again using the `CentralStorageStrategy `and compare the training time.\n",
    "> Please follow the steps in the [Training at Scale Using the Distribution Strategies API](#training-at-scale-using-the-distribution-strategies-api) section above.\n",
    "11. Fine-tune a model of our choice on Vertex AI, using either Keras Tuner or Vertex AI’s hyperparameter tuning service.\n",
