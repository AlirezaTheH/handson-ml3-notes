    "## Vanishing/Exploding Gradients Problem\n",
    "- Gradients often get smaller and smaller as the backpropagation progresses down to the lower layers. As a result, the gradient descent update leaves the lower layers’ connection weights virtually unchanged, and training never converges to a good solution. This is called the *vanishing gradients* problem.\n",
    "- In some cases, the gradients can grow bigger and bigger until layers get insanely large weight updates and the algorithm diverges. This is the *exploding gradients* problem, which happens most often in recurrent neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, deep neural networks suffer from unstable gradients; different layers may learn at widely different speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "It wasn’t clear what caused the gradients to be so unstable until in a 2010 paper [“Understanding the Difficulty of Training Deep Feedforward Neural Networks”](https://homl.info/47), Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio showed that with popular sigmoid activation function and the normal weight initialization (mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1), the variance of the outputs of each layer is much greater than the variance of its inputs. Going forward in the network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer until the activation function saturates at the top layers. This saturation is actually made worse by the fact that the sigmoid function has a mean of 0.5, not 0."

They argue that we need the variance of the outputs of each layer to be equal to the variance of its inputs, and we need the gradients to have equal variance before and after flowing through a layer in the reverse direction. It is actually not possible to guarantee both unless the layer has an equal number of inputs and outputs (*fan_in* and *fan_out*), but they proposed a good compromise that work well in practice: the connection weights of each layer must be initialized randomly as described in the following equation.

A neuron dies when its weights get tweaked in such a way that the input of the ReLU function is negative for all instances in the training set.

Solution: It’s often possible to fuse the BN layer with the previous layer after training, thereby avoiding the runtime penalty. This is done by updating the previous layer’s weights and biases so that it directly produces outputs of the appropriate scale and offset. e.g. if the previous layer computes $\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{W}+\\mathbf{b}$ then the BN layer will compute $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\otimes(\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{W}+\\mathbf{b}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})/\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ (ignoring the smoothing term $\\varepsilon$ in the denominator).

So, if we replace the previous layer’s weights and biases with the updated weights and biases, we can get rid of the BN layer (TFLite’s converter does this automatically).\n",

    "## Reusing Pretrained Layers\n",
    "If we can find an existing neural network that accomplishes a similar task to the one we are trying to tackle, then we can generally reuse most of its layers, except for the top ones. This technique is called *transfer learning*. It will not only speed up training considerably, but also requires significantly less training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If the input pictures for our new task don’t have the same size as the ones used in the original task, we will usually have to add a preprocessing step to resize them to the size expected by the original model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some guidelines:\n",
    "- The output layer of the original model should usually be replaced because it is most likely not useful at all for the new task, and probably will not have the right number of outputs.\n",
    "- The upper hidden layers of the original model are less likely to be as useful as the lower layers, since the high-level features that are most useful for the new task may differ significantly from the ones that were most useful for the original task. We want to find the right number of layers to reuse.\n",
    "- The more similar the tasks are, the more layers we will want to reuse (starting with the lower layers). For very similar tasks, try to keep all the hidden layers and just replace the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common approach:\n",
    "1. Try freezing all the reused layers first, then train our model and see how it performs.\n",
    "2. Then try unfreezing one or two of the top hidden layers to let backpropagation tweak them and see if performance improves. The more training data we have, the more layers we can unfreeze. It is also useful to reduce the learning rate when we unfreeze reused layers: this will avoid wrecking their fine-tuned weights.\n",
    "4. If we still cannot get good performance, and we have little training data, try dropping the top hidden layer(s) and freezing all the remaining hidden layers again.\n",
    "5. We can iterate until we find the right number of layers to reuse.\n",
    "6. If we have plenty of training data, we may try replacing the top hidden layers instead of dropping them, and even adding more hidden layers."

    "Suppose we want to tackle a complex task for which we don’t have much labeled training data, but also we cannot find a model trained on a similar task. It is often cheap to gather unlabeled training examples, but expensive to label them. If we can gather plenty of unlabeled training data, we can try to use it to train an unsupervised model, such as an autoencoder or a GAN. Then we can reuse the lower layers of the autoencoder or the lower layers of the GAN’s discriminator, add the output layer for our task on top, and fine-tune the final network using supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was this technique that Geoffrey Hinton and his team used in 2006 which led to the revival of neural networks and the success of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until 2010, unsupervised pretraining (typically with restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs)) was the norm for deep nets, and only after the vanishing gradients problem was alleviated did it become much more common to train DNNs purely using supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early days of deep learning it was difficult to train deep models, so people would use a technique called *greedy layer-wise pretraining*. They would first train an unsupervised model with a single layer, typically an RBM, then they would freeze that layer and add another one on top of it, then train the model again (effectively just training the new layer), then freeze the new layer and add another layer on top of it, train the model again, and so on.\n",

    "If we do not have much labeled training data, one last option is to train a first neural network on an auxiliary task for which we can easily obtain or generate labeled training data, then reuse the lower layers of that network for our actual task. The first neural network’s lower layers will learn feature detectors that will likely be reusable by the second neural network.\n",

    "- To build a system to recognize faces, we may only have a few pictures of each individual. Gathering hundreds of pictures of each person would not be practical. We can gather a lot of pictures of random people on the web and train a first neural network to detect whether or not two different pictures feature the same person.\n",

    "### Momentum\n",
    "Imagine a bowling ball rolling down a gentle slope on a smooth surface: it will start out slowly, but it will quickly pick up momentum until it eventually reaches terminal velocity (if there is some friction or air resistance). This is the core idea behind *momentum optimization*, proposed by Boris Polyak in 1964 in [“Some Methods of Speeding Up the Convergence of Iteration Methods”](https://homl.info/54).\n",
    "\n",
    "ًRegular gradient descent will take small steps when the slope is gentle and big steps when the slope is steep, but it will never pick up speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum optimization cares a great deal about what previous gradients were: at each iteration, it subtracts the local gradient from the momentum vector $\\mathbf{m}$ (multiplied by the learning rate $\\eta$), and it updates the weights by adding this momentum vector. The gradient is used as an acceleration, not as a speed. To simulate some sort of friction mechanism and prevent the momentum from growing too large, the algorithm introduces a new hyperparameter $\\beta$, called the *momentum*, which must be set between 0 (high friction) and 1 (no friction). A typical momentum value is 0.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Equation 11-5** Momentum algorithm\n",
    "1. $\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\mathbf{m}\\gets\\beta\\mathbf{m}−\\eta\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$\n",
    "2. $\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\gets\\boldsymbol{\\theta}+\\mathbf{m}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can verify that if the gradient remains constant, the terminal velocity (i.e., the maximum size of the weight updates) is equal to that gradient multiplied by the learning rate $\\eta$ multiplied by $1/(1–\\beta)$ (ignoring the sign). e.g. if $\\beta=0.9$, then the terminal velocity is equal to 10 times the gradient times the learning rate, so momentum optimization ends up going 10 times faster than gradient descent! This allows momentum optimization to escape from plateaus much faster than gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: In deep neural networks that don’t use batch normalization, the upper layers will often end up having inputs with very different scales, so using momentum optimization helps a lot. It can also help roll past local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Due to the momentum, the optimizer may overshoot a bit, then come back, overshoot again, and oscillate like this many times before stabilizing at the minimum. This is one of the reasons it’s good to have a bit of friction in the system: it gets rid of these oscillations and thus speeds up convergence."

    "Consider the elongated bowl problem again: gradient descent starts by quickly going down the steepest slope, which does not point straight toward the global optimum, then it very slowly goes down to the bottom of the valley. It would be nice if the algorithm could correct its direction earlier to point a bit more toward the global optimum. The *AdaGrad algorithm*, proposed in [“Adaptive Subgradient Methods for Online Learning and Stochastic Optimization”](https://homl.info/56) by John Duchi et al. in 2011, achieves this correction by scaling down the gradient vector along the steepest dimensions.\n",

If the cost function is steep along the $i^\\text{th}$ dimension, then $s_i$ will get larger and larger at each iteration.\n",
    "2. The second step is almost identical to gradient descent, but the gradient vector is scaled down by a factor of $\\sqrt{\\mathbf{s}+\\varepsilon}$ ($\\varepsilon$ is a smoothing term to avoid division by zero, typically set to $10^{–10}$).\n",

    "*Adam*, proposed in [“Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization”](https://homl.info/59) by Diederik P. Kingma and Jimmy Ba in 2014, which stands for *adaptive moment estimation*, combines the ideas of momentum optimization and RMSProp: just like momentum optimization, it keeps track of an exponentially decaying average of past gradients; and just like RMSProp, it keeps track of an exponentially decaying average of past squared gradients. These are estimations of the mean and (uncentered) variance of the gradients. The mean is often called the *first moment* while the variance is often called the *second moment*, hence the name of the algorithm.\n",

    "AdamW, proposed in [“Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization”](https://homl.info/adamw) by Ilya Loshchilov, and Frank Hutter in 2017, is a variant of Adam that integrates a regularization technique called *weight decay*. Weight decay reduces the size of the model’s weights at each training iteration by multiplying them by a decay factor such as 0.99. It can be shown mathematically that $\\ell_2$ regularization is equivalent to weight decay when using SGD. In practice, combining Adam with $\\ell_2$ regularization results in models that often don’t generalize as well as those produced by SGD. AdamW fixes this issue by properly combining Adam with weight decay.\n",

However, a 2017 paper [“The Marginal Value of Adaptive Gradient Methods in Machine Learning”](https://homl.info/60) by Ashia C. Wilson et al. showed that they can lead to solutions that generalize poorly on some datasets. So when we are disappointed by our model’s performance, we can try using NAG instead: our dataset may just be allergic to adaptive gradients. "

After $s$ steps, the learning rate is down to $\\eta_0/2$. After $s$ more steps it is down to $\\eta_0/3$, then it goes down to $\\eta_0/4$, then $\\eta_0/5$, and so on.

    "1cycle was introduced in a 2018 paper [“A Disciplined Approach to Neural Network Hyper-Parameters: Part 1—Learning Rate, Batch Size, Momentum, and Weight Decay”](https://homl.info/1cycle) by Leslie Smith. It starts by increasing the initial learning rate $\\eta_0$, growing linearly up to $\\eta_1$ halfway through training. Then it decreases the learning rate linearly down to $\\eta_0$ again during the second half of training, finishing the last few epochs by dropping the rate down by several orders of magnitude (still linearly). $\\eta_1$ is chosen using the same approach we used to find the optimal learning rate, and $\\eta_0$ is usually 10 times lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a momentum, we start with a high momentum first (e.g., 0.95), then drop it down to a lower momentum during the first half of training (e.g., down to 0.85, linearly), and then bring it back up to the maximum value (e.g., 0.95) during the second half of training, finishing the last few epochs with that maximum value. This feat was dubbed *super-convergence*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ExponentialLearningRate` custom callback updates the learning rate during training, at the end of each batch. It multiplies it by a constant `factor`. It also saves the learning rate and loss at each batch. Since `logs['loss']` is actually the mean loss since the start of the epoch, and we want to save the batch loss instead, we must compute the mean times the number of batches since the beginning of the epoch to get the total loss so far, then we subtract the total loss at the previous batch to get the current batch’s loss."

    "\n",
    "At every training step, every neuron (including the input neurons, but always excluding the output neurons) has a probability $p$ of being temporarily “dropped out”, meaning it will be entirely ignored during this training step, but it may be active during the next step. The hyperparameter $p$ is called the *dropout rate*, and it is typically set between 10% and 50%: closer to 20%–30% in recurrent neural nets, and closer to 40%–50% in convolutional neural networks. After training, neurons don’t get dropped anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $p$ is 75%: on average only 25% of all neurons are active at each step during training. This means that after training, a neuron would be connected to four times as many input neurons as it would be during training. To compensate for this fact, we need to multiply each neuron’s input connection weights by four during training. If we don’t, the neural network will not perform well as it will see different data during and after training. More generally, we need to divide the connection weights by the *keep probability* ($1-p$) during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons trained with dropout cannot co-adapt with their neighboring neurons; they have to be as useful as possible on their own. They also cannot rely excessively on just a few input neurons; they must pay attention to each of their input neurons. They end up being less sensitive to slight changes in the inputs. In the end, we get a more robust network that generalizes better.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "1. What is the problem that Glorot initialization and He initialization aim to fix?\n",
    "> Glorot initialization and He initialization were designed to make the output standard deviation as close as possible to the input standard deviation, at least at the beginning of training. This reduces the vanishing/exploding gradients problem.\n",
    "2. Is it OK to initialize all the weights to the same value as long as that value is selected randomly using He initialization?\n",
    "> No, all weights should be sampled independently; they should not all have the same initial value. One important goal of sampling weights randomly is to break symmetry: if all the weights have the same initial value, even if that value is not zero, then symmetry is not broken (i.e., all neurons in a given layer are equivalent), and backpropagation will be unable to break it. Concretely, this means that all the neurons in any given layer will always have the same weights. It’s like having just one neuron per layer, and much slower. It is virtually impossible for such a configuration to converge to a good solution.\n",
    "3. Is it OK to initialize the bias terms to 0?\n",
    "> It is perfectly fine to initialize the bias terms to zero. Some people like to initialize them just like weights, and that’s OK too; it does not make much difference.\n",
    "4. In which cases would we want to use each of the activation functions we discussed in this chapter?\n",
    "> ReLU is usually a good default for the hidden layers, as it is fast and yields good results. Its ability to output precisely zero can also be useful in some cases. Moreover, it can sometimes benefit from optimized implementations as well as from hardware acceleration. The leaky ReLU variants of ReLU can improve the model’s quality without hindering its speed too much compared to ReLU. For large neural nets and more complex problems, GLU, Swish and Mish can give us a slightly higher quality model, but they have a computational cost. The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) can be useful in the output layer if we need to output a number in a fixed range (by default between –1 and 1), but nowadays it is not used much in hidden layers, except in recurrent nets. The sigmoid activation function is also useful in the output layer when we need to estimate a probability (e.g., for binary classification), but it is rarely used in hidden layers (there are exceptions e.g., for the coding layer of variational autoencoders). The softplus activation function is useful in the output layer when we need to ensure that the output will always be positive. The softmax activation function is useful in the output layer to estimate probabilities for mutually exclusive classes, but it is rarely (if ever) used in hidden layers.\n",
    "5. What may happen if we set the `momentum` hyperparameter too close to 1 (e.g., 0.99999) when using an SGD optimizer?\n",
    "> The algorithm will likely pick up a lot of speed, hopefully moving roughly toward the global minimum, but its momentum will carry it right past the minimum. Then it will slow down and come back, accelerate again, overshoot again, and so on. It may oscillate this way many times before converging, so overall it will take much longer to converge than with a smaller `momentum` value.\n",
    "6. Name three ways we can produce a sparse model.\n",
    "> One way to produce a sparse model (i.e., with most weights equal to zero) is to train the model normally, then zero out tiny weights. For more sparsity, we can apply $\\ell_1$ regularization during training, which pushes the optimizer toward sparsity. A third option is to use the TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit.\n",
    "7. Does dropout slow down training? Does it slow down inference (i.e., making predictions on new instances)? What about MC dropout?\n",
    "> Yes, dropout does slow down training, in general roughly by a factor of two. However, it has no impact on inference speed since it is only turned on during training. MC Dropout is exactly like dropout during training, but it is still active during inference, so each inference is slowed down slightly. More importantly, when using MC Dropout we generally want to run inference 10 times or more to get better predictions. This means that making predictions is slowed down by a factor of 10 or more.\n",
    "8. Practice training a deep neural network on the CIFAR10 image dataset:\n",
    "- **a.** Build a DNN with 20 hidden layers of 100 neurons each (that’s too many, but it’s the point of this exercise). Use He initialization and the Swish activation function."

The previous model took 29 epochs to reach the lowest validation loss, while the new model achieved that same loss in just 12 epochs and continued to make progress until the 17th epoch. The BN layers stabilized training and allowed us to use a much larger learning rate, so convergence was faster.\n",

    "> - *How does BN affect training speed?* Although the model converged much faster, each epoch took about 15s instead of 10s, because of the extra computations required by the BN layers. But overall the training time (wall time) to reach the best model was shortened by about 10%.\n",
