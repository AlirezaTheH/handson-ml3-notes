    "## From Biological to Artificial Neurons\n",
    "ANNs were first introduced back in 1943 by the neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and the mathematician Walter Pitts in their landmark paper [“A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity”](https://homl.info/43), which they presented a simplified computational model of how biological neurons might work together in animal brains to perform complex computations using *propositional logic*.\n",
    "\n",
    "After two long winters (1960s, 1980s), we are now witnessing yet another wave of interest in ANNs. Here are a few good reasons to believe that this time is different:\n",
    "- There is now a huge quantity of data available to train neural networks, and ANNs frequently outperform other ML techniques on very large and complex problems.\n",
    "- The tremendous increase in computing power since the 1990s now makes it possible to train large neural networks in a reasonable amount of time. This is in part due to Moore’s law (the number of components in integrated circuits has doubled about every 2 years over the last 50 years), but also thanks to the gaming industry, which has stimulated the production of powerful GPU cards by the millions. Moreover, cloud platforms have made this power accessible to everyone.\n",
    "- The training algorithms have been improved. To be fair they are only slightly different from the ones used in the 1990s, but these relatively small tweaks have had a huge positive impact.\n",
    "- Some theoretical limitations of ANNs have turned out to be benign in practice. e.g. many people thought that ANN training algorithms were doomed because they were likely to get stuck in local optima, but it turns out that this is not a big problem in practice, especially for larger neural networks: the local optima often perform almost as well as the global optimum.\n",
    "- ANNs seem to have entered a virtuous circle of funding and progress. Amazing products based on ANNs regularly make the headline news, which pulls more and more attention and funding toward them, resulting in more and more progress and even more amazing products."

    "In the early 1960s several researchers discussed the possibility of using gradient descent to train neural networks, but they failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1970, a researcher named Seppo Linnainmaa introduced in his master’s thesis a technique to compute all the gradients of the model’s error with regard to the model parameters automatically and efficiently. This algorithm is now called *reverse-mode automatic differentiation* (or reverse-mode auto‐diff for short). These gradients can then be used to perform a gradient descent step. If we repeat this process of computing the gradients automatically and taking a gradient descent step, the neural network’s error will gradually drop until it eventually reaches a minimum. This combination of reverse-mode autodiff and gradient descent is now called *backpropagation* (or *backprop* for short).\n",
    "\n",
    "Backprop wasn’t mainstream until in 1985 David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams published [“Learning Internal Representations by Error Propagation”](https://homl.info/44) analyzing how backpropagation allowed neural networks to learn useful internal representations. Today it is the most popular technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how backprop works in detail:\n",
    "- It handles one mini-batch at a time (e.g, containing 32 instances each), and it goes through the full training set multiple times. Each pass is called an *epoch*.\n",
    "- Each mini-batch enters the network through the input layer. It then computes the output of all the neurons in the first hidden layer, for every instance in the mini-batch. The result is passed on to the next layer, and so on until we get the output of the last layer, the output layer. This is the *forward pass*: it is exactly like making predictions, except all intermediate results are preserved since they are needed for the backward pass.\n",
    "- Next, it measures the network’s output error.\n",
    "- Then it computes how much each output bias and each connection to the output layer contributed to the error. This is done analytically by applying the *chain rule*, which makes this step fast and precise.\n",
    "- It then measures how much of these error contributions came from each connection in the layer below, again using the chain rule, working backward until it reaches the input layer (propagating the error gradient backward).\n",
    "- Finally, it performs a gradient descent step to tweak all the connection weights in the network, using the error gradients it just computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning**: It is important to initialize all the hidden layers’ connection weights randomly, or else training will fail (*break the symmetry*). e.g., if we initialize all weights and biases to zero, then all neurons in a given layer will be perfectly identical, and thus backpropagation will affect them in exactly the same way, so they will remain identical. In other words, despite having hundreds of neurons per layer, our model will act as if it had only one neuron per layer."

    "If the training set was very skewed, with some classes being overrepresented and others underrepresented, it would be useful to set the `class_weight` argument when calling the `fit()` method, to give a larger weight to underrepresented classes and a lower weight to overrepresented classes. These weights would be used by Keras when computing the loss. If we need per-instance weights, set the `sample_weight` argument. If both `class_weight` and `sample_weight` are provided, then Keras multiplies them. Per-instance weights could be useful, e.g., if some instances were labeled by experts while others were labeled using a crowdsourcing platform: we might want to give more weight to the former. We can also provide sample weights (but not class weights) for the validation set by adding them as a third item in the `validation_data` tuple."

    "- The most important hyperparameter. In general, the optimal learning rate is about half of the maximum learning rate (i.e., the learning rate above which the training algorithm diverges). One way to find a good learning rate is to train the model for a few hundred iterations, starting with a very low learning rate (e.g., $10^{-5}$) and gradually increasing it up to a very large value (e.g., 10). This is done by multiplying the learning rate by a constant factor at each iteration (e.g., by ($10/10^{-5})^{1/500}$ to go from $10^{-5}$ to 10 in 500 iterations). If we plot the loss as a function of the learning rate (using a log scale for the learning rate), we should see it dropping at first. But after a while, the learning rate will be too large, so the loss will shoot back up: the optimal learning rate will be a bit lower than the point at which the loss starts to climb (typically about 10 times lower than the turning point). We can then reinitialize our model and train it normally using this good learning rate.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "1. The [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) is a handy neural network simulator built by the TensorFlow team. In this exercise, we will train several binary classifiers in just a few clicks, and tweak the model’s architecture and its hyperparameters to gain some intuition on how neural networks work and what their hyperparameters do. Take some time to explore the following:\n",
    "   - **a.** The patterns learned by a neural net. Try training the default neural network by clicking the Run button (top left). Notice how it quickly finds a good solution for the classification task. The neurons in the first hidden layer have learned simple patterns, while the neurons in the second hidden layer have learned to combine the simple patterns of the first hidden layer into more complex patterns. In general, the more layers there are, the more complex the patterns can be.\n",
    "   - **b.** Activation functions. Try replacing the tanh activation function with a ReLU activation function, and train the network again. Notice that it finds a solution even faster, but this time the boundaries are linear. This is due to the shape of the ReLU function.\n",
    "   - **c.** The risk of local minima. Modify the network architecture to have just one hidden layer with three neurons. Train it multiple times (to reset the network weights, click the Reset button next to the Play button). Notice that the training time varies a lot, and sometimes it even gets stuck in a local minimum.\n",
    "   - **d.** What happens when neural nets are too small. Remove one neuron to keep just two. Notice that the neural network is now incapable of finding a good solution, even if you try multiple times. The model has too few parameters and systematically underfits the training set.\n",
    "   - **e.** What happens when neural nets are large enough. Set the number of neurons to eight, and train the network several times. Notice that it is now consistently fast and never gets stuck. This highlights an important finding in neural network theory: large neural networks rarely get stuck in local minima, and even when they do these local optima are often almost as good as the global optimum. However, they can still get stuck on long plateaus for a long time.\n",
    "   - **f.** The risk of vanishing gradients in deep networks. Select the spiral dataset (the bottom-right dataset under “DATA”), and change the network architecture to have four hidden layers with eight neurons each. Notice that training takes much longer and often gets stuck on plateaus for long periods of time. Also notice that the neurons in the highest layers (on the right) tend to evolve faster than the neurons in the lowest layers (on the left). This problem, called the *vanishing gradients* problem, can be alleviated with better weight initialization and other techniques, better optimizers (such as AdaGrad or Adam), or batch normalization.\n",

Why is it generally preferable to use a logistic regression classifier rather than a classic perceptron (i.e., a single layer of threshold logic units trained using the perceptron training algorithm)? How can we tweak a perceptron to make it equivalent to a logistic regression classifier?\n",
    "> A classical perceptron will converge only if the dataset is linearly separable, and it won’t be able to estimate class probabilities. In contrast, a logistic regression classifier will generally converge to a reasonably good solution even if the dataset is not linearly separable, and it will output class probabilities. If we change the perceptron’s activation function to the sigmoid activation function (or the softmax activation function if there are multiple neurons), and if we train it using gradient descent (or some other optimization algorithm minimizing the cost function, typically cross entropy), then it becomes equivalent to a logistic regression classifier.\n",
    "4. Why was the sigmoid activation function a key ingredient in training the first MLPs?\n",
    "> Because its derivative is always nonzero, so gradient descent can always roll down the slope. When the activation function is a step function, gradient descent cannot move, as there is no slope at all.\n",
    "5. Name three popular activation functions. Can we draw them?\n",

    "> To classify email into spam or ham, we just need one neuron in the output layer, indicating the probability that the email is spam. We would typically use the sigmoid activation function in the output layer when estimating a probability. For MNIST, we need 10 neurons in the output layer, and we must replace the sigmoid function with the softmax activation function, which can handle multiple classes, outputting one probability per class. For housing prices, we need one output neuron, using no activation function at all in the output layer.\n",
    "8. What is backpropagation and how does it work? What is the difference between backpropagation and reverse-mode autodiff?\n",
    "> Backpropagation is a technique used to train artificial neural networks. It first computes the gradients of the cost function with regard to every model parameter (all the weights and biases), then it performs a gradient descent step using these gradients. This backpropagation step is typically performed thousands or millions of times, using many training batches, until the model parameters converge to values that (hopefully) minimize the cost function. To compute the gradients, backpropagation uses reverse-mode autodiff (although it wasn’t called that when backpropagation was invented, and it has been reinvented several times). Reverse-mode autodiff performs a forward pass through a computation graph, computing every node’s value for the current training batch, and then it performs a reverse pass, computing all the gradients at once. So what’s the difference? Well, backpropagation refers to the whole process of training an artificial neural network using multiple backpropagation steps, each of which computes gradients and uses them to perform a gradient descent step. In contrast, reverse-mode autodiff is just a technique to compute gradients efficiently, and it happens to be used by backpropagation.\n",
    "9. Can we list all the hyperparameters we can tweak in a basic MLP? If the MLP overfits the training data, how could we tweak these hyperparameters to try to solve the problem?\n",
    "> The number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each hidden layer, and the activation function used in each hidden layer and in the output layer. In general, the ReLU activation function (or one of its variants) is a good default for the hidden keras.layers. For the output layer, in general we will want the sigmoid activation function for binary classification, the softmax activation function for multiclass classification, or no activation function for regression. If the MLP overfits the training data, we can try reducing the number of hidden layers and reducing the number of neurons per hidden layer.\n",
